        Naftali Bennett, who has been sworn in as Israel’s new prime minister, embodies many of the contradictions that define the 73-year-old nation. <br><br>
  
  He is a religious Jew who made millions in the mostly secular hi-tech sector; a champion of the settlement movement who lives in a Tel Aviv suburb; a former ally of Benjamin Netanyahu who has partnered with centrist and left-wing parties to end his 12-year rule.
  
  His ultranationalist Yamina party won just seven seats in the 120-member Knesset in March elections — the fourth such vote in two years.
  
  But by refusing to commit to Mr Netanyahu or his opponents, Mr Bennett positioned himself as kingmaker. <br><br>
  Even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest over the new coalition deal, he ended up with the crown.
